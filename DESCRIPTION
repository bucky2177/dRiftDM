Description: UNDER CONSTRUCTION! This package will help users to fit a drift diffusion model
    with a time-dependent drift rate. The goal is to provides useful
    functions to easily implement, fit, and explore a drift diffusion
    model. The package also comes with pre-implemented drift diffusion
    models for fitting data from conflict tasks. Version 0.1.0 is not meant for use yet!
