# dRiftDM: Estimating (Time-Dependent) Drift Diffusion Models

Fit and explore Drift Diffusion Models (DDMs), a common tool in
psychology for describing decision processes in simple tasks. It can
handle both time-independent and time-dependent DDMs. You either choose
prebuilt models or create your own, and the package takes care of model
predictions and parameter estimation. Model predictions are derived via
the numerical solutions provided by Richter, Ulrich, and Janczyk (2023,
[doi:10.1016/j.jmp.2023.102756](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmp.2023.102756)
).
