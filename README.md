# dRiftDM

The package dRiftDM was developed to help psychology researchers apply
time-dependent diffusion models in R. It comes with necessary tools for
standard analyses, such as building a model, estimating parameters
across multiple participants (separately per participant), or creating
summary statistics. It also ships with pre-built models. Currently,
these are:

- The Diffusion Model for Conflict Tasks
- The Shrinking Spotlight Model
- The Standard (Ratcliff) Diffusion Model

With version 0.1.1 model predicitons (i.e., their first-passage time)
are derived by numerically solving the Kolmogorov-Forward Equation based
on code provided by Richter et al.Â (2023, JMP).

## Installation

You can install the development version of dRiftDM from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bucky2177/dRiftDM")
```

## Example

We are in the progress of publishing a tutorial with more detailed
instructions. For now, here is an example on how to fit the Diffusion
Model for Conflict Tasks to some synthetic data using bounded
Nelder-Mead:
